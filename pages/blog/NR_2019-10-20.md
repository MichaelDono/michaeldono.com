## Week 5 (w/c 14th October)

This week was mostly working on developing a web app that would allow NR staff to view the status of their new Windows 10 device. Due to the scale of rolling out nearly 40,000 laptops and desktops to users with a variety of applications that need to be supported, the process is not as simple as mailing out a laptop to them.
To address this shortfall in the customer experience (MyIT likes to think of the users as customers rather than, well, users) I was asked if I would be able to develop a order tracking tool akin to what you'd find on Amazon.
I was really happy to get this work assigned to me - web development is one of the areas I'm most interested in. I was able to get the basic HTML and CSS done pretty quickly - though building out the backend was pretty new to me and took quite a lot of learning.
I also had the chance to go for some drinks after for a leaving-do. Seeing my colleagues in a much more informal light was quite refreshing; the corporate athmosphere otherwise lends itself well to Imposter Syndrome in my experience.
