- On Wed 5th Feb I attended a half day course about change management.
- Some of it was useful and interesting, though things like the "Tetra Map" felt too much like psuedoscience to me.
- He mentioned emotional competencies, this prompted me to ask about emotional intelligence as I know from psychometric tests I'm not great at it
- I went away and did some research on it, which drew attention to the critism it and EQ has. I did find a book on psychometric tests in the knowledge centre though, so I want to give that a read to prepare for future job applications.
