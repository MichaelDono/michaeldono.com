## Week 3 (w/c 30th September)

In my third week I was out of the office for three days up at NR's office in Manchester (SQ1) where I was helping with the deployment of Windows 10 devices to the IT Support team there. I met some people there who I've since done some more work with and hopefully should provide plenty more work in the future.
As far as I recall this was the week I started working directly with one of the few developers working in house. The main project in this area is a Windows application in C# and using Windows Forms. It's not the sexiest project to work on and the tests are non-existant, though it is suprisingly complex and again, a source of plenty of work.
As far as I can recall this is when I started attending the (mostly) daily Standups for SecureIT.

- Trip to square one to deploy to End User Compute (EUC). Helps to see how we deploy in advance of RG1 and RG2 - though this was done all in house without CC, the contractors who will help with the main releases.
- Met the team there working on app smoke testing, and later UAT. Testing is a big issue for the programme as there's so many apps on the estate.
- Started attending the SecureIT standups on Tues,Wed,Thurs so hopefully I'll find something to work on within this workstream.
