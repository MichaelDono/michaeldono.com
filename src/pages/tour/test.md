The USB is part of the Helix site. This area of Newcastle has a long history. The entire site used to be used to brew Newcastle Brown Ale, and before that it was a coal mine.

Tyne Brewery closed in 2005, after which the area has changed drastically.

This photo shows the former bottling plant (now The Core, opposite the People's Kitchen). The Core opened in 2014, the first part of what was then Science Central.

The Key opened in 2016 just behind it. The Urban Sciences Building opened in 2017, and The Biosphere is opening this month.

The Learning and Teaching Centre opens Autumn 2019, providing more teaching spaces for the Computing and Business Schools. The Lumen, The Spark and National Innovation Centres
 for Data and Aging are well underway.

This photo shows what is now the Sandman Signature Hotel and Shark Bar - it wasn't long ago that this was the head office of Scottish and Newcastle Brewery  (Newcastle Brown Ale) - its history is acknowledged by the famous Brown Ale Blue Star on the building.

The Helix site is a sustainable urban development - open, green space for education, research and living. Almost all buildings have gardens on their roofs 
(The USB has the meadow and terrace). Work will soon be starting on Smart Homes that can be remotely controlled via public WiFi on the entire site.
