The USB is part of the Helix site. This area of Newcastle has a long history. The entire site used to be used to brew Newcastle Brown Ale, and before that it was a coal mine.

Tyne Brewery closed in 2005, after which the area has changed drastically.

This photo shows the former bottling plant (now The Core, opposite the People's Kitchen). The Core opened in 2014, the first part of what was then Science Central.

The Key opened in 2016 just behind it. The Urban Sciences Building opened in 2017, and The Biosphere is opening this month.
