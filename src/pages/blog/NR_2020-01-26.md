It's been forever since I wrote an update - December was very quiet though.
The key events in the last two weeks was attending a talk by Aidan Hancock and Simon for the New Entrants Programme - it was interesting to hear from people on the exec about the bigger picture. Follow up meeting in June.
MyDeviceTracker is finally 'live' in some capacity. The server config has been fixed, now just to wait for Business Change and Comms to make comments so I can make the final changes and go live to everyone in scope of MyIT (i.e. everyone at NR...)
There's a backlog of work for the DST which I plan to work on. There's also a scope for unit testing the code, and I'd also like to implement some QoL improvements that I don't think DQ would even consider, though I am pretty bad at UX myself. I'd like to research UX design if I get a moment.
