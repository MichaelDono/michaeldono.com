# Week 10

Monday - deep dive on the cause of data conflicts, spent a while planning RG1 travel (might be taking the sleeper train, woo!).
Tuesday - 1-2-1 with Helen. I was getting pretty bad IS this morning (personality conflict with manager?) but she reassured me that getting through tasks slower isn't an issue, considering colleague's experience.
I also felt pretty meh about my productivity. I think it may be worth setting up daily To-Do lists so I can decide what I want to get through each day, while keeping an eye on blocked tasks.
Wednesday - Went to Waterloo General office today. Helped out a user who'd been unhappy with the assistance provided to them so I put in all the effort I could to get them all sorted. Also helped track down DIAs, I'll aim to send emails to remaining ones in Waterloo while I'm in Glasgow.
Thursday - Travel to York.
