# Week 11

Monday - A short morning in the office catching up on emails and doing time sensitive tasks. Went to BP at 11 for the taster day, meet the volunteer manager and the line manager for stewards, alongside other potential volunteers. I had a 20 minute informal interview about my experience and what I wanted to get out of the role then I had to get the train to Glasgow.
I heard back later that day that they wanted to offer me the role, which I'm really excited about.
Wanted to do some work while on the train but took ill :(

Tuesday - Quite uneventful. Just using my access to help non-NR deployment staff and lending a hand with issues newly deployed users were having. One guy had an issue with his device that seemed like a software/config issue but the problem seemed to go away when using a different device. I think I'll take the device and try it myself in MK.
NR resources don't seem well used. I think this should go into an RG1 lessons learnt - I'll aim to find out if there's anything planned for a retorspective.
