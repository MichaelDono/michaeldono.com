# Week 12

Monday - Paddington, just built some pens and sorted a pile of laptops.
Tuesday - Very quiet, very little to do. As a result I choose to spend Wednesday in QMK instead of Paddington as was planned.
Wednesday - Back in the office for the first time in a while, wrote some tests and relearning my own code (gives an interesting perspective on others reading my code, and the need for refactoring as the design becomes understood). Secret Santa selections, catching up on industy news via the library.
Really need to get DQ to sort the server but he's not at his usual desk and I'm a bit anxious of 'nagging' him to sort the server for me. I may want to talk about this with someone I can trust?
