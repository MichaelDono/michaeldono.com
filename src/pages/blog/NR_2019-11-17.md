# Week 9

- Demonstated app on Monday to business change & others. Migrated from TFVS to Git.
- Put the first unit tests in place, including one for a behaviour I haven't implemented yet. I find that when developing with new, unfamiliar technlogies and frameworks it's hard to test and even harder to use TDD, so I'm happy I'm confident enough with ASP.Net Core, Enity Framework Core and C# overall to be tinkering with TDD.

- Tuesday was the SecureIT retrospective and Sprint planning. I didn't get all the tasks from last sprint done. Part of this was because the scope of the task was not well understood, but upon reflection I think it's partly because I've been prioritising things I find more enjoyable over the SecureIT work.

- The two tasks I have for this sprint were carried over from the last one. Because of that I think I may have some slack in my workload - at the same time, I expect to be busy with other commitments like a half-day volunteering at Bletchley Park and a two day trip to York with Network Rail this Thursday and Friday, along with a lot of MyDevice deployment on and off-site.

- I'll bring up the potential lack of work in a standup next week. Even if I can't commit to any more tasks it would at least be useful to start thinking about the next steps.
