            <span>Newcastle is one of only 5 cities in the UK to have a Chinatown. The first Chinese restaurant in Newcastle opened in 1949. The Chinese community in Tyne and Wear rapidly grew in the 1960s,
                though the first Chinese business didn't move to Stowell Street until 1978. Many others followed suit, and in 1988 the street signs became bilingual - by which point the area had become
                one of the most characterful and distinct in Newcastle. The Chinese Arch was built in 2004 on St Andrew's Street and stands 11 metres tall, costing Â£475,000.</span>
            <span>Chinatown is a good shortcut to The Gate, Bigg Market, and Central station. Of course, there's many takeaways and restaurants here, as well as Chinese supermarkets.</span>

            <span>The monument was built in 1838 to celebrate the Great Reform Act of 1832.
                        The act was wrote by the Prime Minister Earl Grey (the one the tea is named after) from Northumberland.
                        It increased the electorate to 650,000 from 400,000 - starting the ball rolling on the UK becoming truly democratic. 
                        All men 21 and over got the right to vote in 1918, and ten years later women. 18 year-olds could only vote after 1969! 
                        This area has changed a lot over the years
                        - it used to be a busy roundabout (you can see the supports that were installed inside the monument for the trams that once ran all over Newcastle)</span>
            <span>Monument is the de facto centre of Newcastle, with Monument Metro station below, the main entrance to Grey's Quarter, many bus services, 
                        and the head of Grey Street and Grainger Street - you can see the Monument along them 
                        (including along Grainger Street as you walk out of Central Station), ideal for knowing where you are.</span>

                      Also just off Grey Street is Tyneside Cinema - Newcastle's only independent cultral cinema, 
                      screening independent and world cinema as well as the usual films on offer at other cinemas.</span>
            <span>To get to the Quayside from here just keep walking straight on, and continue south along Dean Street. Grey street connects onto High Bridge - 
                      where there's bars, pubs and a comedy club. It's easy to not know it exists!</span>

                        The name comes from being a busy marketplace for "Bigg", a type of barley.
