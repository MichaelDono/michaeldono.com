                                        The USB is part of the Helix site. This area of Newcastle has a long history. The entire site used to be used to brew Newcastle Brown Ale, and before that it was a coal mine.
                                        Tyne Brewery closed in 2005, after which the area has changed drastically.

                                        This photo shows the former bottling plant (now The Core, opposite the People's Kitchen). The Core opened in 2014, the first part of what was then Science Central.
                                        The Key opened in 2016 just behind it. The Urban Sciences Building opened in 2017, and The Biosphere is opening this month.

                                        (The USB has the meadow and terrace). Work will soon be starting on Smart Homes that can be remotely controlled via public WiFi on the entire site.

                                    <span>Newcastle is one of only 5 cities in the UK to have a Chinatown. The first Chinese restaurant in Newcastle opened in 1949. The Chinese community in Tyne and Wear rapidly grew in the 1960s,
                                         though the first Chinese business didn't move to Stowell Street until 1978. Many others followed suit, and in 1988 the street signs became bilingual - by which point the area had become
                                         one of the most characterful and distinct in Newcastle. The Chinese Arch was built in 2004 on St Andrew's Street and stands 11 metres tall, costing Â£475,000.

                                        Chinatown is a good shortcut to The Gate, Bigg Market, and Central station. Of course, there's many takeaways and restaurants here, as well as Chinese supermarkets.

                                        The monument was built in 1838 to celebrate the Great Reform Act of 1832.
                                        The act was wrote by the Prime Minister Earl Grey (the one the tea is named after) from Northumberland.
                                        It increased the electorate to 650,000 from 400,000 - starting the ball rolling on the UK becoming truly democratic. 
                                        All men 21 and over got the right to vote in 1918, and ten years later women. 18 year-olds could only vote after 1969! 
                                        This area has changed a lot over the years
                                        - it used to be a busy roundabout (you can see the supports that were installed inside the monument for the trams that once ran all over Newcastle)

                                        Monument is the de facto centre of Newcastle, with Monument Metro station below, the main entrance to Grey's Quarter, many bus services, 
                                        and the head of Grey Street and Grainger Street - you can see the Monument along them 
                                        (including along Grainger Street as you walk out of Central Station), ideal for knowing where you are.

                                            Also just off Grey Street is Tyneside Cinema - Newcastle's only independent cultral cinema,

                                            where there's bars, pubs and a comedy club. It's easy to not know it exists!
